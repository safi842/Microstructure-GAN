Abstract: *The microstructure of material strongly influences its mechanical properties
and the microstructure itself is influenced by the processing conditions. Thus,
establishing a Process-Structure-Property relationship is a crucial task in material design and is of interest in many engineering applications. In this work,
the processing-structure relationship is modelled as deep learning based conditional image synthesis problem. This approach is devoid of feature engineering,
needs little domain awareness, and can be applied to a wide variety of material
systems. We develop a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to synthesize
images based on given processing conditions. Results show that our GAN model
can produce high-fidelity multiphase microstructures which have a good correlation with the given processing conditions*
